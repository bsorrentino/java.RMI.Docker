The mailnly goal of this project is to understand RMI and find out the best alternative minimising the rework on legacy projects

We are evaluating:

1. Revamped version of **HTTP Tunneling**
   > Take a look at module [proxy](https://github.com/bsorrentino/java.RMI.labs/tree/develop/tunneling/proxy) in [tunneling](https://github.com/bsorrentino/java.RMI.labs/tree/develop/tunneling)
2. [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) implementations
 * Evaluation of [simple-json-rpc](https://github.com/bsorrentino/simple-json-rpc) implementation forked by [artem](https://github.com/arteam/simple-json-rpc).
   > Take a look at module [simple-json-rpc](https://github.com/bsorrentino/java.RMI.labs/tree/develop/json-rpc/simple-json-rpc) under [jason-rpc](https://github.com/bsorrentino/java.RMI.labs/tree/develop/json-rpc) parent
